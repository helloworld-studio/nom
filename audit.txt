Security Audit Report for Nom Application
Based on my comprehensive review of your codebase, I've identified several security vulnerabilities and concerns that should be addressed. Here's my analysis:

Critical Vulnerabilities
Exposed API Keys in Frontend
The RPC_URL containing Solana API keys is stored in localStorage and potentially exposed in the frontend
The application loads RPC_URL directly from environment variables or localStorage without proper obfuscation
Insufficient Input Validation
The /api/token/analytics/:mint endpoint accepts user input without proper validation before creating PublicKey objects
SwapComponent.js accepts user input for slippage values with minimal validation
Vulnerable Dependencies
As noted in your memories, there are high severity vulnerabilities in axios related to CSRF and SSRF
Buffer overflow vulnerability in bigint-buffer
RegEx DoS vulnerability in semver
Insecure API Calls
Direct calls to external APIs (Raydium) in SwapComponent.js without proper error handling or request validation
TokenMonitor.js makes axios requests to potentially untrusted URIs from token metadata
Hardcoded Sensitive Values
Hardcoded token addresses and pool IDs in SwapComponent.js
Hardcoded program IDs in multiple files
Moderate Vulnerabilities
Insufficient Rate Limiting
The rate limiter in nom.js only protects the /api/analyze endpoint (100 requests per hour)
Other API endpoints lack rate limiting, making them vulnerable to DoS attacks
Insecure CORS Configuration
CORS policy allows any origin that includes 'localhost' or 'nom-ibs6.onrender.com'
Potential for DNS rebinding attacks if an attacker can register a domain containing these strings
Unvalidated External Content
The application fetches and displays metadata from token URIs without proper sanitization
Links to external websites, Twitter, and Telegram are displayed without warning users
Wallet Connection Security
No verification of wallet signature to confirm user identity
Direct access to window.solana without proper checks for phishing protection
LLM API Key Exposure Risk
The Agent.js service uses an LLM API key from environment variables
If environment variables are misconfigured, this could leak to logs or error messages
Low Vulnerabilities
Missing Content Security Policy
No evidence of CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
Insufficient Error Handling
Many catch blocks expose detailed error messages to users
Error details could reveal implementation details to attackers
Lack of Input Sanitization
User inputs for amounts and slippage are not properly sanitized before use
No Protection Against Transaction Manipulation
No verification that transaction parameters haven't been tampered with
Insecure Random Number Generation
Use of Math.random() for generating values in the application
Recommendations
Protect Sensitive Keys
Move all RPC URL handling to the backend
Create a proxy endpoint for Solana RPC requests
Never store API keys in localStorage or expose them to the frontend
Implement Proper Input Validation
Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
Sanitize all user inputs before processing
Update Dependencies
Update axios to the latest version to address CSRF and SSRF vulnerabilities
Implement a regular dependency scanning process
Enhance API Security
Implement comprehensive rate limiting across all endpoints
Add request validation middleware
Use HTTPS for all connections
Improve CORS Configuration
Use a strict whitelist for allowed origins
Avoid using string.includes() for CORS origin validation
Implement proper CORS preflight handling
Implement Content Security Policy
Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
Restrict inline scripts and styles
Enhance Error Handling
Implement centralized error handling
Log detailed errors server-side but return generic messages to users
Add error tracking and monitoring
Secure External Content
Sanitize all external content before displaying
Add warnings for external links
Implement a content proxy for external resources
Add Transaction Verification
Implement additional checks to verify transaction integrity
Add transaction simulation before sending
Secure Random Number Generation
Use crypto.getRandomValues() instead of Math.random()
Implement proper cryptographic functions for sensitive operations
By addressing these vulnerabilities, you can significantly improve the security posture of your Nom application and protect your users from potential attacks.
