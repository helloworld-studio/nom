Welcome to Nom, a real-time Solana token monitoring application. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding your information when you use our application.

## Information We Don't Collect

**Nom does not collect any personal data from users.** Our application operates without:

- User accounts or registration
- Collection of personal information
- Tracking cookies or similar technologies
- Analytics that identify individual users

## How Nom Works

Nom operates by:

1. Connecting to the Solana blockchain through your provided RPC endpoint

## Third-Party Services

When using Nom, you may interact with third-party services:

- **RPC Providers**: Your RPC URL may be used to connect to the Solana network but is not stored or shared
